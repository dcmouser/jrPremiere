## ZoomKeys
This extension will modify a clip to add some keyframes to make a smoother zoom/pan effect.

## What Adobe host apps this sample supports
- Premier Pro

## How to install
### Move the `ZoomKeys` folder to the extension folder
Note that the extension folder location is different depending on which OS you use. 
On Windows the directory is C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\CEP\extensions\
See [CEP Cookbook](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_8.x/Documentation/CEP%208.0%20HTML%20Extension%20Cookbook.md#extension-folders) for more details
See [AEScripts Guide](https://aescripts.com/knowledgebase/index/view/faq/zxp-installer-faq/) for more details

## Requirements
IMPORTANT NOTE: All of these extensions make use of my shared helper extension, com.dc.jrlib, listed above -- so you NEED to install that in addition to whatever of my extensions you install.

## How to use
Open the ZoomKeys extension panel from the Adobe Premiere menu "Windows->Extensions".
Set options.
Press Run.
