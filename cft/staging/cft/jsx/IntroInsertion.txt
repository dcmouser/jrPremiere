1. User moves playhead to the place in their video where they want the intro spliced in.
2. Split all clips at that playhead location.
3. Move the all clips after this point rightward for the duration of the intro video
4. The intro video we split into 2 parts, the transparent begining (with duration IntroTransDuration; can we use marker for this?) and the rest.
5. Now put the transparent part of intro right after the video split point, on an upper video track
6. Create a hold frame of the main video on the main video track after the main part (and under the trans intro).
7. Put the 2nd half of the intro after that, back on the main video track, right before the main video continues.
8. Add transition at the end of 2nd part of intro where it segues to main video
9. Add grain effect to the hold frame segment
